        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This simple recipe is quick and perfect for any time you want a warm, comforting meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of your preferred bread (white or whole grain work well)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter (softened to room temperature for easier spreading)</li>
            <li>2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar or American cheese melts nicely)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the butter evenly on one side of each slice of bread. This is the side that will face outwards during grilling to make it crispy and golden.</li>
            <li>Place the cheese slices between the two pieces of bread, with the buttered sides facing outwards.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has completely melted.</li>
        </ol>
