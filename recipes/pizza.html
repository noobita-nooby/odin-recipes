        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple and quick homemade pizza can be made using a straightforward dough recipe and your choice of toppings. This process involves a short rise time for the dough and bakes in about 15-20 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For the Dough:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tbsp instant or active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water (around 105-110°F or 40-43°C)</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>For the Toppings:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1-2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Desired toppings (e.g., pepperoni, sliced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Dough: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast, letting it sit for a few minutes until frothy (if using active dry yeast). Stir in the flour, salt, and olive oil, and mix until a slightly sticky dough forms. Knead gently for a minute or two</li>
            <li>Rise: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn it over to coat, and cover with a damp towel. Let it rise for 20-25 minutes in a warm spot until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Punch down the dough and roll or stretch it out with your fingertips to fit a greased or cornmeal-dusted baking pan. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the base, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Top & Bake: Add your desired cheese and toppings. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Serve: Slice and serve your homemade pizza hot.</li>
        </ol>
